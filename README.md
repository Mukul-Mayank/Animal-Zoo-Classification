# Animal-Zoo-Classification
This project involves building a K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) classifier to predict animal classes from a zoo dataset. It includes data cleaning (handling missing values, encoding categorical features, outlier detection), model training, evaluation, and real-time predictions for new inputs.
